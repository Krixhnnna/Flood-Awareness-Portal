    <h1>Flood Safety Tips</h1>
        <p>Floods can pose significant risks to life and property. Here are essential safety tips:</p>
        <h1 class="headingsafety">Before a Flood</h1>
        <p>Flood safety begins with preparation. Follow the links below to learn more about these essential flood safety measures.</p>
        <h3>Flood Warnings and Triggers</h3>
        <p>Understanding whether your property is in a flood-risk area is crucial. The Environment Agency offers a free ‘Flood Warning and Alert Service’. You can check your flood risk and sign up for flood warnings by visiting our ‘Am I at Risk’ page, by <a href="Flood Risk Map.html">clicking here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Flood Plan</h3>
        <p>A flood plan should contain all the steps you would take if a flood alert or warning is issued, along with important contact details. Make sure you are aware of evacuation centres and have alternate routes.</p>

<h3>Flood Insurance</h3>
<p>
    Flooding to a household can cause serious damage if you don’t have flood protection in place, or if the protection you have has failed or is overwhelmed. You should ensure that you have adequate cover for both your buildings and contents. If you live in a flood risk area you will want to be insured for flood risk, however insurance for households in flood risk areas is often very expensive or even unaffordable.</p>
<br>

        <h1 class="headingsafety">During a Flood</h1>
        <p>During a flood, prioritise safety by following the advice of professionals and emergency services. If you’re in immediate danger, call 999 for help. Never enter or drive through floodwaters to ensure your safety.</p>
        <h2>Reporting flooding</h2>
        <p>
            Reporting flooding is critical in ensuring that risk management authorities (RMAs) are aware of problems and can deal with incidents effectively. It is important that you know who to report the different types of flooding to and continue to report each incident, to allow RMAs to collate data to keep track of the overall picture of flooding in that area.</p>
        <h2>Important thinks to Do</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Listen to local weather updates on the radio or your smartphone.</li>
            <li>Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters, as just six inches of water can knock a person over and one foot can move a vehicle.</li>
            <li>Move to higher ground if flooding is imminent, or go to the highest level of your home.</li>
            <li>Turn off utilities if instructed to prevent potential hazards.</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Risk of drowning</h2>
<p>During floods, the murky and turbulent water often obscures its actual depth, causing people to underestimate the associated risks. Floodwaters can conceal hazards such as potholes and manholes, which are challenging to spot while submerged and can lead to falls or becoming trapped. Additionally, floodwaters can transport debris capable of causing injury, highlighting the need for caution and vigilance when dealing with floodwater to prevent potential harm or accidents.</p>
        <h1 class="headingsafety">After a Flood</h1>
        <h2>Re-entering your home</h2>
        <p>Before re-entering your home after a flood event, take a moment to assess its structural condition. Floodwater can erode foundations, damage load-bearing walls, and harm essential systems, like electrical and plumbing, compromising the overall structural stability. If you notice any visible damage, it’s crucial to consult with a professional before entering to avoid potential risks.</p>
        <h2>Mental health</h2>
        <p>Flooding can have profound and enduring impacts on mental health, often affecting individuals and communities long after the floodwaters recede. The aftermath of a flood, with its challenges such as displacement, financial stress, and complex insurance claims, can lead to increased risks of mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Vulnerable groups like the elderly and children may be particularly affected.</p>
        <h2>Important thinks to Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay clear of floodwater, which may contain sewage, chemicals, or debris.</li>
            <li>Inspect your home for structural damage before entering and avoid electrical wires.</li>
            <li>Document any damages with photos for insurance purposes.</li>
            <li>Clean and disinfect your home thoroughly to avoid contaminants. Wear protective clothing during cleanup.</li>
